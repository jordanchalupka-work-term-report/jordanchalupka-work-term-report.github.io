                      of Guelph. For the past 8 months I have been working at Adknown, in Guelph. The purpose of this blog
                      is to document my time at Adknown; covering topics such as my goals, projects I was involved with,
                      and skills that I gained through this work experience.

                      For my first two work terms I had the pleasure to work for
                      <a href="https://www.adknown.com/">Adknown</a>, a leading web and app publishing company with a passion for ad-tech. The development team at Adknown works on developing and maintaing software used
                      by the marketing, and game development team, as well as many inovative side-projects.

                       One awesome part about my experience working at Adknown was the quarterly events. During my first work term the Adknown
                      team went to see the Toronto Blue Jays play and during my second work term we went axe throwing and to a board game café.

                      During my time at Adknown I worked as a Software Engineer. In this role I was given the opportunity to work on a large number
                      of projects such as creating user-interfaces, designing websites, creating tools, and more. One of my favourite parts of working at Adknown was the diversity of projects that I was able to work on. As far as programming languages I used PHP and Nodejs.

                      <br>
                      Every Monday morning I participated in the developer meeting, with all of the other developers. In this meeting each developer would discuss what they had worked on in the previous
                      week, any issues, questions, or cool findings that came along the way, and what they were planning
                      to work on the next week. I felt that these meetings were a really great way to keep everyone on the
                      developer team in tune with what was happening in the company. 
                      <!-- Often during or shortly after developer
                      meetings other developers would ask to speak to me about new tools that I was using, in order to see
                      if they would be appropriate for their own project requirements. -->

                    <p>
                      During my work terms I was able to use a lot of new and interesting technologies.  For example before starting at Adknown I had no prior experience with AWS, and by the end of the work term I am comfortable using several different services provided by AWS.

                      <p>
                        In order to automate the creation of new domains I created a tool which interacted with several AWS services such as Route53, Cloudfront, and CertificateManager in order to register new domains. To make this tool I was able to use many Lambda, and Step-Functions. Later in my work term this tool was also integrated with a domain-name generation API using prefix/suffix combinations.

                        One of the first projects I worked on at Adknown was creating an organizational tool for the game development team to better communicate the creation and status of games created by the game development team.
                        This tool was created using Bootstrap-tables linked to a database. One memory from this project was that it was my first experience
                        managing requirements from multiple groups as both the game developers, as well as management had requirements for the tool and it was necessary to combine everyone's requirements into the final product.

                        I also created a tool to assist in adding images for our content based sites. A requirement for this tool was that images needed to be cropped to specific dimensions specified by the creator of the site. To build this tool I used a javascript library called cropper.js to assist in the image cropping.  The tool allowed the user to simply select which predefined dimension they would like to crop their image to (from a list of possible dimensions) and the tool would automatically crop the image to the desired dimensions.  The user could then move the crop around the image to position it nicely.

                    <p>
                      <br> One of my goals even before coming to Adknown was to learn more about different AWS services and how
                      to effictively utilize them. Since Adknown has identified the value in using AWS, I spent alot of time learning about and getting familiar with several AWS services and so have accomplished
                      my goal. In fact, I was even able to learn and use a new AWS tool called Step Functions, and introduce
                      this technology in a presentation to the development team. I believe that knowing how to leverage AWS services is a very transferable skill to future work experiences.
                      <br> 
                      <br>
                      Another goal that I had this semester was to improve my web development skills. Although I had previous
                      experience in web-development before working at Adknown, I feel that this experience has helped my
                      to take a more systematic approach to web development.  Also, I feel that my front-end development skills have improved a lot since I started working at Adknown, and I now feel much more confortable with making changes to the look and design of a web page.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                       While alot of the projects that I worked on at Adknown were given to me based on technologies I had learned in my own time
                      outside of school, I feel that many of my courses greatly assisted me during my time at Adknown. One course that I felt greatly
                      prepared me was CIS*2750 where one of the challenges is to work with a large codebase. Another course which I felt greatly
                      assisted me is CIS*3530 Data Base Systems and Concepts. Having taken a course stricly on database design and applications
                      I felt prepared to complete work requireing database knowledge, and that while there were new things that I learned, I was
                      able to complete many jobs much faster and with less assistance.

                      <li><p>Ensure that tasks are completed based on the business requirements vs the tech for the solution being perfect. Sometimes it's better to put out a hacked up version of something to see if it will work before spending a lot of time and
                      effort getting it perfect the first time.</p></li>

                      <li><p>Being able to talk to the end user directly about business requirements is invaluable and should be leveraged whenever possible. This allows errors to be caught early and improves the overall quality of the software produced.</p></li>

                       I would consider my first two work terms a huge success. I learned a lot, gained valuable experiences, got to work with
                      a great team, and had some fun while doing it. I would like to thank Tim and Andrew for giving me this opportunity, and to the rest of the Adknown team for being awesome.

                    <p>
                      Best of luck to Adknown with your new office space and future employees.
